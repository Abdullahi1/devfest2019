👀  Writing DevFest19 App using [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/), in 100% Kotlin. 

### Background

This is a basic app that shows how to use Dynamic App Modules, which allow you to separate certain features and resources from the base module of your app and include them in your App Bundle. 

Users can download and install these modules later on demand after they've already installed the base APK of the app using Dynamic Delivery.
